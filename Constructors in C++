Output of following program?

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Point {
    Point() { cout << "Constructor called"; }
};
 
int main()
{
   Point t1;
   return 0;
}
Run on IDE
(A) Compiler Error
(B) Runtime Error
(C) Constructor called


Answer: (A) 

Explanation: By default all members of a class are private. Since no access specifier is there for Point(), it becomes private and it is called outside the class when t1 is constructed in main.
