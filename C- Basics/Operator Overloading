How can we restrict dynamic allocation of objects of a class using new?
(A) By overloading new operator
(B) By making an empty private new operator.
(C) By making an empty private new and new[] operators
(D) By overloading new operator and new[] operators


Answer: (C) 

Explanation: If we declare new and [] new operators, then the objects cannot be created anywhere (within the class and outside the class)
See the following example. We can not allocate an object of type Test using new.

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Test {
private:
    void* operator new(size_t size) {}
    void* operator new[](size_t size) {}
};

int main()
{
    Test *obj = new Test;
    Test *arr = new Test[10];
    return 0;
}



In C++, following operators can not be overloaded:

. (Member Access or Dot operator)
?: (Ternary or Conditional Operator )
:: (Scope Resolution Operator)
.* (Pointer-to-member Operator )
sizeof (Object size Operator)
typeid (Object type Operator)








Which of the following operators are overloaded by default by the compiler in every user defined classes even if user has not written?

1) Comparison Operator ( == )
2) Assignment Operator ( = ) 
(A) Both 1 and 2
(B) Only 1
(C) Only 2
(D) None of the two


Answer: (C) 

Explanation: Assign operator is by default available in all user defined classes even if user has not implemented. The default assignement does shallow copy.

But comparison operator “==” is not overloaded.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
private:
    int real, imag;
public:
    Complex(int r = 0, int i =0)  {real = r;   imag = i;}
};

int main()
{
    Complex c1(10, 5), c2(2, 4);

    // For example, below code works fine
    c1 = c2;

    // But this code throws compiler error
    if (c1 == c2)
       cout << "Same";

    return 0;
}





How does C++ compiler differs between overloaded postfix and prefix operators?
(A) C++ doesn’t allow both operators to be overlaoded in a class
(B) A postfix ++ has a dummy parameter
(C) A prefix ++ has a dummy parameter
(D) By making prefix ++ as a global function and postfix as a member function.


Answer: (B) 

Explanation: See the following example:

class Complex
{
private:
    int real;
    int imag;
public:
    Complex(int r, int i)  {  real = r;   imag = i; }
    Complex operator ++(int);
    Complex & operator ++();
};

Complex &Complex::operator ++()
{
    real++; imag++;
    return *this;
}

Complex Complex::operator ++(int i)
{
    Complex c1(real, imag);
    real++; imag++;
    return c1;
}

int main()
{
    Complex c1(10, 15);
    c1++; 
    ++c1;
    return 0;
}




Predict the output

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class A
{
    int i;
public:
    A(int ii = 0) : i(ii) {}
    void show() {  cout << i << endl;  }
};
 
class B
{
    int x;
public:
    B(int xx) : x(xx) {}
    operator A() const {  return A(x); }
};
 
void g(A a)
{
    a.show();
}
 
int main()
{
    B b(10);
    g(b);
    g(20);
    return 0;
}
Run on IDE
(A) Compiler Error
(B)

10
20
(C)

20
20
(D)

10
10

Answer: (B) 

Explanation: Note that the class B has as conversion operator overloaded, so an object of B can be converted to that of A.

Also, class A has a constructor which can be called with single integer argument, so an int can be converted to A.
